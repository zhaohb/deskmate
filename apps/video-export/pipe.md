Export a video of my screen activity from the last 5 minutes.

Read pc_assistant skill first.

Use the POST /frames/export endpoint with the time range and fps=1.0. Then show me the exported video file path as an inline code block so I can watch it.

If the export is large, suggest a lower fps or shorter time range.
